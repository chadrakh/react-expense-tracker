# React Expense Tracker
A responsive expense tracker using React which allows you to add new expenses, filter existing expenses,
and it also provides a visual of exenditures for the chosen year by month. The next update will be to save
new expenses to local storage when the application is ran and to add an export button which will allow the
user to export the expenditures.
